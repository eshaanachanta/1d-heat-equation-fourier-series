# 1d-heat-equation-fourier-series
This project shows how Fourier analysis can be used to understand heat diffusion in a 1D rod. An initial temperature curve is broken into simpler sine waves each of which evolves independently in time. The combined contribution of each mode explains how temperature spreads and smooths out over time.
